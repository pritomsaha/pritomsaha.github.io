Hi, I’m **Pritom Saha Akash**, an **Applied Scientist II at Amazon (Prime Video & Amazon MGM Studios)**. I recently completed my **Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**, where I conducted research spanning **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **multi-agent systems**, and **recommender systems**.

My research focuses on **semantic modeling**, **LLM-based generation**, and **agentic frameworks** for improving **search, recommendation, and content discovery**. I am particularly interested in how **structured representations** and **multi-agent reasoning** can better align **user intent**, **item relevance**, and **domain knowledge**. At Amazon, I work within the **Prime Video Personalization and Discovery Science** team, researching and developing **LLM- and ML-based methods** for **personalization, evaluation, and content discovery**. My work has been published at venues including **ACL, EMNLP, IJCAI, and PAKDD**, and I previously gained industry research experience through internships at **Amazon** and **IBM Research**.
