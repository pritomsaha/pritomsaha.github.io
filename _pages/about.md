I am an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon and a fourth-year Ph.D. student in [the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://cs.illinois.edu/). Currently, I am working as a Teaching Assistant at CS@UIUC and a PhD Student Researcher at eBay. During the summer of 2023, I worked as a Research Scientist Intern at [IBM Research - Almaden Lab](https://research.ibm.com/labs/almaden) where my manager was [Lucian Popa](https://research.ibm.com/people/lucian-popa). Before that, I had an experience as a Research Assistant at the Data and Information Systems ([DAIS](https://cs.illinois.edu/research/areas/data-and-information-systems)) Laboratory under the supervision of my Ph.D. advisor [Professor Kevin C.C. Chang](https://ece.illinois.edu/directory/profile/kcchang). I am also fortunate to work with [Professor ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/) under [IBM-Illinois Center for Cognitive Computing Systems Research (C3SR)](https://www.c3sr.com/). Before being admitted to UIUC as a Ph.D. student, I completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Software Engineering from [Institute of Information Technology, University of Dhaka](https://www.du.ac.bd/body/IIT). I did my master [thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357158890_An_Evidential_Inter-node_Hellinger_Distance_based_Tree_Classifier) on improving the performance of tree-based classifiers (Decision trees and Random forests). 

Research interests: **Natural Language Processing** (i.e., understanding and using LLMs), **Text Mining** and **Recommender Systems**.
