I am a first-year PhD student in [Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://cs.illinois.edu/). I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. Degree in Software Engineering from [University of Dhaka](https://www.du.ac.bd/). I am currently employed as a research assistant in UIUC (supervised by [Prof. Kevin C.C. Chang](https://ece.illinois.edu/directory/profile/kcchang)). My research interest is in Text Mining, Information Retrieval and Machine Learning.
