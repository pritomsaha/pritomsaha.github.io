> I am a third-year Ph.D. student in [Department of Computer Science, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://cs.illinois.edu/). My Ph.D. advisor is [Professor Kevin C.C. Chang](https://ece.illinois.edu/directory/profile/kcchang), and I am currently employed as a research assistant at Data and Information Systems ([DAIS](https://cs.illinois.edu/research/areas/data-and-information-systems)) Laboratory under his supervision.  Alongside my advisor, I am also fortunate to work with [Professor ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/) under [IBM-Illinois Center for Cognitive Computing Systems Research (C3SR)](https://www.c3sr.com/).

> Before admitting to UIUC as a Ph.D. student, I completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Software Engineering from [Institute of Information Technology, University of Dhaka](https://www.du.ac.bd/body/IIT). I did my master [thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357158890_An_Evidential_Inter-node_Hellinger_Distance_based_Tree_Classifier) on improving the performance of tree-based classifiers (Decision trees and Random forests) under the supervision of [Dr. Mohammad Shoyaib](http://www.iit.du.ac.bd/about_iit/individual_teacher/48) and [Amin Ahsan Ali](http://www.cse.iub.edu.bd/faculties/53). My research mainly lies in **Text Mining** & **Natural Language Processing**, including Information Extraction, Selection and Summarization with recent interest in Recommender System.
