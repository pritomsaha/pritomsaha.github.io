Hi, I’m **Pritom Saha Akash**, a fifth-year Ph.D. student and Graduate Research Assistant in [Computer Science at UIUC](https://cs.illinois.edu/), advised by [Professor Kevin Chang](https://ece.illinois.edu/directory/profile/kcchang). My research interests lie in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**—from **text mining** to **LLM-based generation**—and **recommender systems**, with a recent focus on **designing multi-agent systems**. I have also contributed to collaborative research projects between **IBM-UIUC** and **eBay-UIUC**.  

Beyond academia, I have gained hands-on industry research experience during the summers of 2023, 2024, and 2025. As a **Research Scientist Intern** at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/labs/almaden) (2023), I worked on **Conversational AI**, and at [Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science) (2024, 2025), I contributed to **LLM-driven Product Search** for Amazon Prime Video.  

I hold **BS and MS degrees in Software Engineering** from the [University of Dhaka, IIT](https://www.du.ac.bd/body/IIT), which laid the groundwork for my current research in **software systems, machine learning, and NLP**.

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student and graduate research assistant in [CS@UIUC](https://cs.illinois.edu/), advised by Professor [Kevin Chang](https://ece.illinois.edu/directory/profile/kcchang). My research focuses on _Natural Language Processing (NLP)_, particularly _Large Language Models (LLMs)_, _Text Mining_, and _Recommender Systems_. In addition, I am a Ph.D. student researcher for the eBay-UIUC collaboration project on Recommender Systems. 

During the summers of 2023 and 2024, I gained industry experience as a Research Scientist Intern at [IBM](https://research.ibm.com/labs/almaden) and as an Applied Scientist Intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science), where I contributed to projects related to Conversational AI and LLM in Product Search. **I will be returning to Amazon as an Applied Scientist Intern in summer 2025.**

Before joining UIUC, I earned my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Software Engineering from the Institute of Information Technology, University of Dhaka ([IITDU](https://www.du.ac.bd/body/IIT)), where I developed a strong foundation in Software Engineering and Machine learning.
